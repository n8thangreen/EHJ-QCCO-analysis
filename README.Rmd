## Bayesian Models for CE Analysis of a Prognostic Model for Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)

### Background

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy(HCM) is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young adults. Current risk algorithms provide only a crude estimate of risk and fail to account for the different effect size of individual risk factors.

### Aim

The aim of this study was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis for the new SCD risk prediction model. See for more information:
[C O'Mahony (2014) A novel clinical risk prediction model for sudden cardiac death in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM risk-SCD). Eur Heart;35(30):2010-20.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24126876/)

### Overview

We develop a predictive model for assessing risk of SCD among patients with HCM.

-   Using individual level data generate posterior distribution samples of probabilities, costs and health values using WinBUGS
-   Simulate with a Markov model using the posterior samples as inputs
-   Compare outcomes for risk groups in terms of cost-effectiveness

The model structure consists of a decision tree component and a Markov model component. In effect this first model is represented by different cohorts of the data in the fitting process.

## Workflow

The main files to perform the analysis are:

-   `prep_study_data.R` munges the raw data and save the input data in `data/`
-   `BUGS/script.R` runs the BUGS code in `BUGS/model.txt`
-   `main-ce-analysis.R` performs the cost-effectiveness analysis
-   `pop_counts_plot.R` creates output plots

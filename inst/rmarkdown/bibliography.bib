abstract = {BACKGROUND:: Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) improve survival and extend lives of patients with severe heart disease. OBJECTIVE:: We sought to evaluate the impact of ICDs on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) during the first 3 years after implantation. SUBJECTS:: A total of 1089 patients from the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial II (MADIT II) were randomized to an ICD or medical treatment only. MEASURES:: Health Utility Index (HUI3) at baseline, 3, 12, 24, and 36 months following randomization; survival data. RESEARCH DESIGN:: We constructed mean profiles of HRQOL for living patients, estimated overall quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), separately by treatment arm, and calculated cumulative QALY gains/losses as the difference between the areas under the treatment specific HRQOL profiles. Multivariate fixed effect regression models were developed to impute the missing HRQOL data using baseline patient characteristics (age, gender, treatment, HUI3 score, diabetes, diuretics use, and NYHA class). Bootstrapped standard errors were calculated for the estimated differences in HRQOL gains/losses between treatment arms. Similarly, we performed subgroup analyses (by gender, age, and baseline NYHA class, blood urine nitrogen, ejection fraction, and QRS). RESULTS:: There were no differences in QALYs loss for living patients by treatment group (ĝ̂'0.037, P ≤ 0.64) or in overall QALYs loss by treatment group (0.043, P ≤ 0.37) over 3 years. In subgroup analysis, female subjects demonstrated a trend towards greater survival benefit (0.298, P ≤ 0.07) and overall QALYs (0.261, P ≤ 0.14). CONCLUSIONS:: Adverse effects of the ICD on HRQOL together with lower HRQOL among survivors may offset the 3-year survival benefits of ICDs.

abstract = {Background: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a heterogeneous disease in which an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) effectively prevents sudden cardiac death in at-risk individuals. Nevertheless, the cost-effectiveness of ICDs in this specific patient group has not been evaluated. Methods: A Markov cohort model was constructed to simulate the course of identified adult persons with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with and without an ICD over the course of 12 years based on Swedish disease-specific unit costs. The age distribution was based on empirical data from the nationwide cohort of HCM patients with ICDs (mean age at the time of implant was 51.8 years). The outcomes were costs per saved life and cost per gained quality adjusted life year (QALY). Results: Of 1000 simulated patients, 402 lives were saved after 12 years with an ICD at a cost of 646,000 Swedish krona (SEK), which corresponds to 57,118 Euro per saved life from the health care sector viewpoint. The cost per gained QALY (the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER)) was 171,000 SEK (15,119 Euro). From a societal viewpoint, including effects on productivity losses, the use of an ICD was absolutely dominant (both cheaper and better, and thus an ICER is of no interest). Both the one-way sensitivity analyses and the probabilistic sensitivity analyses supported the findings in the base option. Conclusion: For identified patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy deemed at high risk of sudden cardiac death, the use of an ICD is extremely cost effective, both in terms of the cost for saved lives and gained QALY.},

abstract = {Objectives: To conduct a cost-benefit assessment of prevention of sudden cardiac deaths with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) versus amiodarone from the perspective of the health-care systems in the UK and France. Methods: Course after implantation with an ICD or taking amiodarone was modeled using discrete event simulation; 1000 pairs of identical patients were simulated 100 times for each analysis. Rates of life-threatening arrhythmia and death from other causes were assumed identical, but the case fatality of arrhythmia and hospitalization differ between treatments. Rates were based on published data, primarily from the Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (SCD-HeFT). Direct medical costs (in 2004 Euros) and lives saved were estimated over 5 years. The monetary value of a life (UK €2.1 million, France €2.0 million) was applied to this benefit and examined relative to the net investment required. Results: ICDs decreased deaths during the 5 years from 37.0% to 29.7% at a net cost of €26,222 to €20,008 per patient, yielding cost-benefit ratios of 0.17 (UK) and 0.14 (France) - more than a 5 to 1 return on investment. Sensitivity analyses showed ICDs represent value for money whenever a life is valued at least at €274,000. Conclusion: In these European countries where society values a life at more than €2 million, ICDs are a worthwhile investment compared with amiodarone for primary prevention of sudden cardiac deaths in patients with heart failure. {\textcopyright} 2007, International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).},

abstract = {The aim of this paper was to review the cost-effectiveness studies of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) for primary or secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD). A systematic review of the literature published in English or Spanish was performed by electronically searching MEDLINE and MEDLINE in process, EMBASE, NHS-EED, and EconLit. Some keywords were implantable cardioverter defibrillator, heart failure, heart arrest, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, syncope, sudden death. Selection criteria were the following: (1) full economic evaluations published after 1995, model-based studies or alongside clinical trials (2) that explored the cost-effectiveness of ICD with or without associated treatment compared with placebo or best medical treatment, (3) in adult patients for primary or secondary prevention of SCD because of ventricular arrhythmias. Studies that fulfilled these criteria were reviewed and data were extracted by two reviewers. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed and a narrative synthesis was prepared. In total, 24 studies were included: seven studies on secondary prevention and 18 studies on primary prevention. Seven studies were performed in Europe. For secondary prevention, the results showed that the ICD is considered cost-effective in patients with more risk. For primary prevention, the cost-effectiveness of ICD has been widely studied, but uncertainty about its cost-effectiveness remains. The cost-effectiveness ratios vary between studies depending on the patient characteristics, methodology, perspective, and national settings. Among the European studies, the conclusions are varied, where the ICD is considered cost-effective or not dependent on the study.},

Methods: A systematic review of the literature of systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials that reported mortality outcomes associated with implantable cardioverter defibrillators compared with antiarrhythmic drug therapy in people at risk of sudden cardiac death due to arrhythmias was undertaken. Economic evaluations were also sought. Inclusion criteria, data extraction, and quality assessment were undertaken by standard methodology. A decision analytic model was constructed using best available evidence to determine cost-effectiveness in a UK setting. Results: Eight randomized controlled trials, two systematic reviews, and a meta-analysis met the inclusion criteria and were of variable quality. Evidence suggests that ICDs reduce mortality in both secondary and primary prevention, although the magnitude of benefit depends on baseline risk for sudden cardiac death. Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year ranged from {\pounds}52,000 ($98,000) to over {\pounds}200,000 ($379,000), depending on mortality risk and assumptions made. Conclusions: Evidence suggests that ICDs reduce total mortality but may be cost-effective only in some subgroups of patients at high risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Further research is needed on risk stratification of patients in whom ICDs are most likely to be clinically and cost-effective. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2007 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {AimsCurrent European guidelines recommend prophylactic implantation of cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) in patients with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) who are not in NYHA class IV and have reasonable life expectancy. Cost and benefit implications of this recommendation have not been reported from a European perspective.Methods and resultsMarkov modelling estimated lifetime costs and effects [life years (LY) and quality-adjusted LY (QALY) gained] of prophylactic ICD implantation vs. conventional treatment, among patients with a reduced LVEF. Efficacy was estimated from a meta-analysis of mortality rates in the six primary prevention trials with inclusion criteria matching ACC/AHA/ESC Class I or IIa recommendations. Direct medical costs were estimated using Belgian national references. Costs and effects were discounted at 3 and 1.5 per annum, respectively. Probabilistic sensitivity and scenario analyses estimated the uncertainty around the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. An ICD implantation increased the lifetime direct costs by €46 413. Estimated mean LY/QALY gained were 1.88/1.57, respectively. Probabilistic analysis estimated mean lifetime cost per QALY gained as €31 717 (95 CI: €19 760-€61 316). Cost-effectiveness was influenced most by ICD efficacy, time to replacement, utility, and patient age at implantation. ConclusionIn a European healthcare setting, prophylactic ICD implantation may be cost-effective if current guidelines for patients with a reduced LVEF are followed.},

It has become a proven and well-accepted therapy not only for secondary but also for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease. In recent years, the international guidelines have extended the indications to the prophylactic ICD, increasing the number of eligible patients and, together, the financial challenges of a widespread implementation.

abstract = {Objective To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), cardiac resynchronisation therapy pacemakers (CRT-Ps) and combination therapy (CRT-D) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction based on a range of clinical characteristics. Methods Individual patient data from 13 randomised trials were used to inform a decision analytical model. A series of regression equations were used to predict baseline all-cause mortality, hospitalisation rates and health-related quality of life and device-related treatment effects. Clinical variables used in these equations were age, QRS duration, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, ischaemic aetiology and left bundle branch block (LBBB). A UK National Health Service perspective and a lifetime time horizon were used. Benefits were expressed as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Results were reported for 24 subgroups based on LBBB status, QRS duration and NYHA class. Results At a threshold of {\pounds}30 000 per QALY gained, CRT-D was cost-effective in 10 of the 24 subgroups including all LBBB morphology patients with NYHA I/II/ III. ICD is cost-effective for all non-NYHA IV patients with QRS duration <120 ms and for NYHA I/II non-LBBB morphology patients with QRS duration between 120 ms and 149 ms. CRT-P was also cost-effective in all NYHA III/IV patients with QRS duration >120 ms. Device therapy is cost-effective in most patient groups with LBBB at a threshold of {\pounds}20 000 per QALY gained. Results were robust to altering key model parameters. Conclusions At a threshold of {\pounds}30 000 per QALY gained, CRT-D is cost-effective in a far wider group than previously recommended in the UK. In some subgroups ICD and CRT-P remain the cost-effective choice.},

We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis for a cohort of patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction <40% and ischaemic or non-ischaemic heart disease.Methods and resultsA Markov decision analytic model was used to evaluate long-term survival, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and lifetime costs for a cohort of patients with a reduced left ventricular function without previous arrhythmias, managed with a prophylactic ICD. Input data on effectiveness were derived from a meta-analysis of primary prophylactic ICD-only therapy randomized trials, from a prospective cohort study of ICD patients, from a health care utilization survey, and from the literature. Input data on costs were derived from a micro-cost analysis. Data on quality-of-life were derived from the literature. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the uncertainty. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated a mean lifetime cost of €50 685 ± €4604 and 6.26 ± 0.64 QALYs for patients in the 'no ICD strategy'. Patients in the 'ICD strategy' accumulated €86 759 ± €3343 and an effectiveness of 7.08 ± 0.71 QALYs yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €43 993/QALY gained compared with the 'no ICD strategy'. The probability that ICD therapy is cost-effective was 65% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of €80 000/QALY.ConclusionOur results suggest that primary prophylactic ICD therapy in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction <40% and ischaemic or non-ischaemic heart disease is cost-effective in the European setting. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author.},

abstract = {Background: Cardiac muscle hypercontractility is a key pathophysiological abnormality in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and a major determinant of dynamic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. Available pharmacological options for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are inadequate or poorly tolerated and are not disease-specific. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of mavacamten, a first-in-class cardiac myosin inhibitor, in symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Methods: In this phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (EXPLORER-HCM) in 68 clinical cardiovascular centres in 13 countries, patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with an LVOT gradient of 50 mm Hg or greater and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II–III symptoms were assigned (1:1) to receive mavacamten (starting at 5 mg) or placebo for 30 weeks. Visits for assessment of patient status occurred every 2–4 weeks. Serial evaluations included echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, and blood collection for laboratory tests and mavacamten plasma concentration. The primary endpoint was a 1{\textperiodcentered}5 mL/kg per min or greater increase in peak oxygen consumption (pVO2) and at least one NYHA class reduction or a 3{\textperiodcentered}0 mL/kg per min or greater pVO2 increase without NYHA class worsening. Secondary endpoints assessed changes in post-exercise LVOT gradient, pVO2, NYHA class, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Clinical Summary Score (KCCQ-CSS), and Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Symptom Questionnaire Shortness-of-Breath subscore (HCMSQ-SoB). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03470545. Findings: Between May 30, 2018, and July 12, 2019, 429 adults were assessed for eligibility, of whom 251 (59%) were enrolled and randomly assigned to mavacamten (n=123 [49%]) or placebo (n=128 [51%]). 45 (37%) of 123 patients on mavacamten versus 22 (17%) of 128 on placebo met the primary endpoint (difference +19{\textperiodcentered}4%, 95% CI 8{\textperiodcentered}7 to 30{\textperiodcentered}1; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0005). Patients on mavacamten had greater reductions than those on placebo in post-exercise LVOT gradient (−36 mm Hg, 95% CI −43{\textperiodcentered}2 to −28{\textperiodcentered}1; p<0{\textperiodcentered}0001), greater increase in pVO2 (+1{\textperiodcentered}4 mL/kg per min, 0{\textperiodcentered}6 to 2{\textperiodcentered}1; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0006), and improved symptom scores (KCCQ-CSS +9{\textperiodcentered}1, 5{\textperiodcentered}5 to 12{\textperiodcentered}7; HCMSQ-SoB −1{\textperiodcentered}8, −2{\textperiodcentered}4 to −1{\textperiodcentered}2; p<0{\textperiodcentered}0001). 34% more patients in the mavacamten group improved by at least one NYHA class (80 of 123 patients in the mavacamten group vs 40 of 128 patients in the placebo group; 95% CI 22{\textperiodcentered}2 to 45{\textperiodcentered}4; p<0{\textperiodcentered}0001). Safety and tolerability were similar to placebo. Treatment-emergent adverse events were generally mild. One patient died by sudden death in the placebo group. Interpretation: Treatment with mavacamten improved exercise capacity, LVOT obstruction, NYHA functional class, and health status in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The results of this pivotal trial highlight the benefits of disease-specific treatment for this condition. Funding: MyoKardia.},

Methods Patients receiving primary prevention single-chamber or dual-chamber ICD implantation at the Leiden University Medical Center were included in the study. Using a Markov model, lifetime cost, life years (LYs), and gained quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated for device recipients and control patients.

Results Primary prevention ICD implantation adds an estimated mean of 2.07 LYs and 1.73 QALYs. Increased lifetime cost for single-chamber and dual-chamber ICD recipients were estimated at €60,788 and €64,216, respectively. This resulted for single-chamber ICD recipients, in an estimated ICER of €35,154 per QALY gained. In dual-chamber ICD recipients, an estimated ICER of €37,111 per QALY gained was calculated. According to the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, estimated cost per QALY gained are €35,837 (95% confidence interval [CI]: €28,368-€44,460) for single-chamber and €37,756 (95% CI: €29,055-€46,050) for dual-chamber ICDs.

abstract={Objective Implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) for primary prevention (PP) of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) are well-established but underutilized globally. The Improve SCA study has identified a cohort of patients called 1.5 primary prevention (1.5PP) based on PP patients with the presence of certain risk factors. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of ICD therapy compared to no ICD among the PP population and the subset of 1.5PP patients in Taiwan. Methods A Markov model was run over a lifetime time horizon from the Taiwan payer perspective. Mortality and utility estimates were obtained from the literature (PP) and the IMPROVE SCA trial (1.5PP). Cost inputs were obtained from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA), Ministry of Health and Welfare. We used a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of NT{\$}2,100,000, as established through standard WTP research methods and in alignment with World Health Organization recommendations. Results The total discounted costs for ICD therapy and no ICD therapy were NT{\$}1,664,259 and NT{\$}646,396 respectively for PP, while they were NT{\$}2,410,603 and NT{\$}905,881 respectively for 1.5PP. Total discounted QALYs for ICD therapy and no ICD therapy were 6.48 and 4.98 respectively for PP, while they were 10.78 and 7.71 respectively for 1.5PP. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio was NT{\$}708,711 for PP and NT{\$}441,153 for 1.5PP, therefore ICD therapy should be considered cost effective for PP and highly cost effective for 1.5PP. Conclusions ICD therapy compared to no ICD therapy is cost-effective in the whole PP population and highly cost-effective in the subset 1.5PP population in Taiwan.},

abstract={The aim of this paper was to review the cost-effectiveness studies of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) for primary or secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD). A systematic review of the literature published in English or Spanish was performed by electronically searching MEDLINE and MEDLINE in process, EMBASE, NHS-EED, and EconLit. Some keywords were implantable cardioverter defibrillator, heart failure, heart arrest, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, syncope, sudden death. Selection criteria were the following: (1) full economic evaluations published after 1995, model-based studies or alongside clinical trials (2) that explored the cost-effectiveness of ICD with or without associated treatment compared with placebo or best medical treatment, (3) in adult patients for primary or secondary prevention of SCD because of ventricular arrhythmias. Studies that fulfilled these criteria were reviewed and data were extracted by two reviewers. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed and a narrative synthesis was prepared. In total, 24 studies were included: seven studies on secondary prevention and 18 studies on primary prevention. Seven studies were performed in Europe. For secondary prevention, the results showed that the ICD is considered cost-effective in patients with more risk. For primary prevention, the cost-effectiveness of ICD has been widely studied, but uncertainty about its cost-effectiveness remains. The cost-effectiveness ratios vary between studies depending on the patient characteristics, methodology, perspective, and national settings. Among the European studies, the conclusions are varied, where the ICD is considered cost-effective or not dependent on the study.},

abstract={Abstract Aims The benefit of prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is not uniform due to differences in the risk of life-threatening ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) and non-arrhythmic mortality. We aimed to develop an ICD benefit prediction score that integrates the competing risks. Methods and results The study population comprised all 4531 patients enrolled in the MADIT trials. Best-subsets Fine and Gray regression analysis was used to develop prognostic models for VT (≥200 b.p.m.)/VF vs. non-arrhythmic mortality (defined as death without prior sustained VT/VF). Eight predictors of VT/VF (male, age{\thinspace}{\&}lt;{\thinspace}75 years, prior non-sustained VT, heart rate{\thinspace}{\&}gt;{\thinspace}75 b.p.m., systolic blood pressure{\thinspace}{\&}lt;{\thinspace}140{\thinspace}mmHg, ejection fraction{\thinspace}≤{\thinspace}25{\%}, myocardial infarction, and atrialarrhythmia) and 7 predictors of non-arrhythmic mortality (age{\thinspace}≥{\thinspace}75 years, diabetes mellitus, body mass index{\thinspace}{\&}lt;{\thinspace}23{\thinspace}kg/m2, ejection fraction{\thinspace}≤{\thinspace}25{\%}, New York Heart Association ≥II, ICD vs. cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillator, and atrial arrhythmia) were identified. The two scores were combined to create three MADIT-ICD benefit groups. In the highest benefit group, the 3-year predicted risk of VT/VF was three-fold higher than the risk of non-arrhythmic mortality (20{\%} vs. 7{\%}, P{\thinspace}{\&}lt;{\thinspace}0.001). In the intermediate benefit group, the difference in the corresponding predicted risks was attenuated (15{\%} vs. 9{\%}, P{\thinspace}{\&}lt;{\thinspace}0.01). In the lowest benefit group, the 3-year predicted risk of VT/VF was similar to the risk of non-arrhythmic mortality (11{\%} vs. 12{\%}, P{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.41). A personalized ICD benefit score was developed based on the distribution of the two competing risks scores in the study population (https://is.gd/madit). Internal and external validation confirmed model stability. Conclusions We propose the novel MADIT-ICD benefit score that predicts the likelihood of prophylactic ICD benefit through personalized assessment of the risk of VT/VF weighed against the risk of non-arrhythmic mortality.},

abstract = {Aims: Risk stratification algorithms for sudden cardiac death (SCD) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and regional differences in clinical practice have evolved over time. We sought to compare primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation rates and associated clinical outcomes in US vs. non-US tertiary HCM centres within the international Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry. Methods and results: We included patients with HCM enrolled from eight US sites (n = 2650) and five non-US (n = 2660) sites and used multivariable Cox-proportional hazards models to compare outcomes between sites. Primary prevention ICD implantation rates in US sites were two-fold higher than non-US sites (hazard ratio (HR) 2.27 [1.89-2.74]), including in individuals deemed at high 5-year SCD risk (???6%) based on the HCM risk-SCD score (HR 3.27 [1.76-6.05]). US ICD recipients also had fewer traditional SCD risk factors. Among ICD recipients, rates of appropriate ICD therapy were significantly lower in US vs. non-US sites (HR 0.52 [0.28-0.97]). No significant difference was identified in the incidence of SCD/resuscitated cardiac arrest among non-recipients of ICDs in US vs. non-US sites (HR 1.21 [0.74-1.97]). Conclusion: Primary prevention ICDs are implanted more frequently in patients with HCM in US vs. non-US sites across the spectrum of SCD risk. There was a lower rate of appropriate ICD therapy in US sites, consistent with a lower-risk population, and no significant difference in SCD in US vs. non-US patients who did not receive an ICD. Further studies are needed to understand what drives malignant arrhythmias, optimize ICD allocation, and examine the impact of different ICD utilization strategies on long-term outcomes in HCM.},
